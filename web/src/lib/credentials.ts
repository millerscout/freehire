//
// Membership and the editorial/credential split come from the generated registry
// (cmd/gen-contracts ← internal/collections). What lives here is only the copy a
// badge needs: which body issued the licence, and the disclaimer that keeps the
// badge from reading as a promise about the role being viewed. A credential added
// upstream with no entry below renders nothing, which a test catches.
